 <li>1. modern operating systems are interrupt driven. If there are no processes to execute, no I/O devices to service, and no users to whom to respond, an operating system will sit quietly, waiting for something to happen. Events are almost always signaled by the occurrence of an interrupt or a trap</li>
 <li>2. A trap (or an exception) is a software-generated interrupt caused either by an error or by a specific request from a user program that an operating-system service is performed.</li>
  <li>3. The interrupt-driven nature of an operating system defines that system's general structure. For each type of interrupt, separate segments of code in the operating system determine what action should be taken. An interrupt service routine is provided that is responsible for dealing with the interrupt.</li>
 <li>4. The operating system and the users share the hardware and software resources of the computer system, we need to make sure that an error in a user program could cause problems only for the one program that was running. With sharing, many processes could be adversely affected by a bug in one program. For example, if a process gets stuck in an infinite loop, this loop could prevent the correct operation of many other processes.</li>
<li>5. Without protection against these sorts of errors, either the computer must execute only one process at a time or all output must be suspect.</li>
