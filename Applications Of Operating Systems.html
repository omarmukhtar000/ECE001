These concepts can be applied to a variety of applications, including military and government systems. The meta-operating system concept might be applied to tactical situations in which there are a large number of sensors deployed, only some of which are useful at a given time, or for which particular personnel are appropriately cleared. In this scenario, the meta-operating system, with components running on sensors and communications gateways, provides the infrastructure to write an application which allows certain personnel to see particular sensors based upon their clearances and perhaps location. For example, a simple application might allow certain soldiers access to data from motion and audio sensors, but only intelligence officers access to data from communications sensors. Meta-operating systems can provide the infrastructure for building more complex applications that span multiple sensors and platforms. An example scenario might be the integration of chemical, biological, and radiographic sensors in homeland security applications. The use of a meta-operating system allows rapid development and deployment of new event collection and filtering applications that can exploit new sensors and processing algorithms, while at the same time providing the appropriate customized views into the system by developers, investigators probing for particular incident types, and general security forces monitoring for attacks. Finally, ambient computing systems might be utilized in more mundane environments such as the residence, in order to enable the long-promised “smart home” scenario.
