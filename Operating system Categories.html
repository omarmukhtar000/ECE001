The main categories of modern OS may be classified into three groups which are distinguished by the nature of interaction that takes place between the computer and the user:
<h3>1. Batch system</h3>In this type of OS, users submit jobs on regular schedule (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly) to a central place where the user of such system did not interact directly with computer system. To speed up the processing, jobs with similar needs were batched together and were run through the computer as a group. Thus, the programmer would leave the programs with the operator. The output from each job would send to the appropriate programmer. The major task of this type was to transfer control automatically from one job to the next.
<h4>Disadvantages of Batch System:</h4>
<h5>*Turnaround time can be large from user standpoint.</h5>
<h5>*Difficult to debug program.</h5>
<h3>2. Time-Sharing System</h3>This type of OS provides on-line communication between the user and the system, the user gives his instructions directly and receives intermediate response, and therefore it called interactive system.
The time sharing system allows many user simultaneously share the computer system. The CPU is multiplexed rapidly among several programs, which are kept in memory and on disk. A program swapped in and out of memory to the disk.
Time sharing system reduces the CPU ideal time. The disadvantage is more complex.
